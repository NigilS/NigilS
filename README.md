- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nigil 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how stuff works.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning parallel processing and machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that needs an extra hand. 
- It doesn't matter if it is just grunt work. For the time being I expect to learn a lot from working with others.
